This is a depreceated C++ Application, which was done for my school project.
We had to use Turbo C++, and so here it is, truely non-portable code, due to extensive use of conio.h.

If you somehow have a Turbo C++ Compiler, change the memory model to Large, or it won't compile.
It is because the default Code Size limit is 64KB!

I wished to port it to ANSI C++, but it is too much for me! Rewriting all of this using ncurses will surely take a lot of time, and is not worth the effort. 
It stays here, for the sake of nostalgia.
It reminds me of the limitation of the rand() function in Turbo C++,the Stock Market Game becomes very predictable when I use that.
